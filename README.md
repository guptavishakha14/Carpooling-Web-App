## Technologies Used

### Django Framework

Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework, which follows the model-template-view architectural pattern.

### Google APIs Used
* **Directions API** - It is used to display route between two points. Route similarity is inferred based on this to broadcast ride request to specific drivers.
* **Distance Matrix API** - It is used to get distance between two points. This is used to decide fare of ride.
*  **Geocoding API** - It is used to convert a place name(For eg: Central Park, New York) to its corresponding coordinates(latitude and longitude). 
*  **Maps JavaScript API** - The API is used to make calls to different APIs using JavaScript.
*  **Places API** - The API is used to get suggestions of places when user types a string.

### Jquery

jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax. 

### Javascript

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

### Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

### Python
